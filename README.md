**S.E.E.K: SOBER, EMPOWERED, ENRICHED, KNOWING**

A comprehensive mobile app to aid addicts in recovery - leveraging personal, private, offline tools such as tracking streaks, journaling and emotional logs as well as online tools like a forum and external self-help resources.

S.E.E.K also modernises the recoery process - making use of **Junko** - the relapse-prevention plan generation AI - to help make recovery work for **you**, and not the other way around!
